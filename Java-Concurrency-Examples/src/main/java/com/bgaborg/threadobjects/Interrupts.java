/**
 * Interrupts
 * <p/>
 * <p>An interrupt is an indication to a thread that it should stop what it is doing and do something else.
 * It's up to the programmer to decide exactly how a thread responds to an interrupt, but it is very
 * common for the thread to terminate.
 * <p/>
 * <p>A thread sends an interrupt by invoking interrupt on the Thread object for the thread to be interrupted.
 * For the interrupt mechanism to work correctly, the interrupted thread must support its own interruption.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <b>The Interrupt Status Flag<b/>
 * The interrupt mechanism is implemented using an internal flag known as the interrupt status.
 * Invoking Thread.interrupt sets this flag. When a thread checks for an interrupt by invoking the static
 * method Thread.interrupted, interrupt status is cleared. The non-static isInterrupted method, which is
 * used by one thread to query the interrupt status of another, does not change the interrupt status flag.
 * <p/>
 * By convention, any method that exits by throwing an InterruptedException clears interrupt status when it does so.
 * However, it's always possible that interrupt status will immediately be set again, by another thread invoking
 * interrupt.
 * <p/>
