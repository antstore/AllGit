/**
 * Deadlock
 * <p/>
 * Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever,
 * waiting for each other. Here's an example.
 * <p/>
 * Alphonse and Gaston are friends, and great believers in courtesy. A strict rule of courtesy
 * is that when you bow to a friend, you must remain bowed until your friend has a chance to
 * return the bow. Unfortunately, this rule does not account for the possibility that two friends
 * might bow to each other at the same time. This example application, Deadlock, models this possibility.
 * <p/>
 * When Deadlock runs, it's extremely likely that both threads will block when they attempt to invoke bowBack. Neither block will ever end, because each thread is waiting for the other to exit bow.
 * <p/>
