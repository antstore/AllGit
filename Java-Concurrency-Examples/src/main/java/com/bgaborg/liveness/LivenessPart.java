/**
 * Liveness
 * <p/>
 * A concurrent application's ability to execute in a timely manner is known as its liveness.
 * This section describes the most common kind of liveness problem, deadlock, and goes on to briefly
 * describe two other liveness problems, starvation and livelock.
 * <p/>
 * Starvation
 * <p/>
 * Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is
 * unable to make progress. This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by
 * "greedy" threads. For example, suppose an object provides a synchronized method that often takes a long
 * time to return. If one thread invokes this method frequently, other threads that also need frequent synchronized
 * access to the same object will often be blocked.
 * <p/>
 * Livelock
 * <p/>
 * A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. If the other thread's action is also a
 * response to the action of another thread, then livelock may result. As with deadlock, livelocked threads are
 * unable to make further progress. However, the threads are not blocked â€” they are simply too busy responding to
 * each other to resume work. This is comparable to two people attempting to pass each other in a corridor:
 * Alphonse moves to his left to let Gaston pass, while Gaston moves to his right to let Alphonse pass.
 * Seeing that they are still blocking each other, Alphone moves to his right, while Gaston moves to his left.
 * They're still blocking each other, so...
